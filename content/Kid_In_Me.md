I have been cherishing Kid in me  
You too have it Inside need to see  
It has gifted me infinite curiosity  
And Taking away deep focusing ability  

I love that innocent Kid in me  
To get something done I need to plea  
Rules of this world are out of his realm  
Often Trivial things tend to overwhelm  
  
He is gifted with unlimited forgiveness  
because of which mostly causes distress  
which causes great amount of confusion  
Forgiving is easy Anger causes mental tension  
  
Guess what This is called a wierd behavior  
After offending how can someone not loose temper  
Offensive statments to be Always followed by Anger  
this is standard practice , called behaving proper  
  
He is proactive , he is creative  
leading a happy life, his life objective  
It is usual to have ideas overflow  
He gets distrubed when asked to be slow  
  
This is Little kid who is integral part of me  
We are part of team, Definatly not enemy  
Failed to tame you I learned to accept as you are  
Whatever had happend or will happen I will keep loving you, Yaar.
