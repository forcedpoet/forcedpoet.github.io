You are like a catalyst in chemical reaction  
Helping speedup the process without doing any action  
Scattered were the words slowly attraction commence   
As Rays of light scattred,concentrate on spot by Lense  
they gather together , caused by mere your presence  
Like some magic trick they suddlenly starts making sense  
I am really unsure of its origin wonder they come whence  
  
As coagulated particles gather near bottom and precipitate  
Words kept poping my head, having a very peculiar kind of trait  
You really feel you don't have any role in this writing  
Maybe catalyst feels same, how it speeds reaction just being  
  
I have no explaination for both the things above mentined   
But really experiment and find every time simmilar result   
this is felt very deeply cann't express to another person  
I'll continue this and Wont't waste more time finiding reason
