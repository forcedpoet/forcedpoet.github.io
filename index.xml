      <description>I have been cherishing Kid in me
You too have it Inside need to see
It has gifted me infinite curiosity
And Taking away deep focusing ability
I love that innocent Kid in me
To get something done I need to plea
Rules of this world are out of his realm
Often Trivial things tend to overwhelm
He is gifted with unlimited forgiveness
because of which mostly causes distress
which causes great amount of confusion</description>

      <description>Try try till you succeed, I keep hearing
can&amp;rsquo;t fall asleep however I try sleeping
Got tested with all types of medical tests
Doctors don&amp;rsquo;t have answers it really frustates
I tried endlessly surrfing TV channels
My fingers aches also have strained eyes
Friend of mine figured our whats the problem
It is lifstyle which ruined my Circadian rhythm
Still remember regular parties late night
By the time they are over sun shined bright</description>

      <description>I am lonely in corner of garage
is it you comming or another mirage
I often dream going out with you
I am sure you feel the same too
I remember early days of our relationship
it was love at first sight or rather peep
Looking through hole of that crowded werehouse
I was eagely waiting to break chains go loose
I cherish those memories of early days
your being possesive about me all ways</description>

      <description>Its not pleasing but its important
snoozing alarm every day makes it redundant
simmilar in life realising
there is problem is&amp;rsquo;t pleasing
In that moment life takes U turn
shatters dreams like earthen urn
we have tendancy of shooting messanger
so we distract ourself running farther
this is really is worse trick
as clock doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop to tick
do we really feel better then
may be yes that is fleeing from pain</description>

      <description>Yes I work at Nine to Five
pobably I am sleep deprive
I have no one to blame for this
tired of chasing that comp increase
I remember how I have started as a fresher
full of hopes and feeling hell lot better
out of collage I was eager to work
good work was sufficient enough perk
As I was burdoned with more and more of it
there came one point where I coudn&amp;rsquo;t take it</description>

      <description>You are like a catalyst in chemical reaction
Helping speedup the process without doing any action
Scattered were the words slowly attraction commence
As Rays of light scattred,concentrate on spot by Lense
they gather together , caused by mere your presence
Like some magic trick they suddlenly starts making sense
I am really unsure of its origin wonder they come whence
As coagulated particles gather near bottom and precipitate
Words kept poping my head, having a very peculiar kind of trait</description>

      <description>First time in Little Life, I hit writers Block
Feeling suffocating as, on chest I have a rock
Crowding inside I have words, Choking me more
I wish to vent them, out of chest I could bore
this is wierd feeling difficult to express
more I try it, more I get feeling of stress
I know the words originate from brain&amp;rsquo;s some part
they travel all the way down by train of thought</description>

      <description>I am proud of me, being procrastinator
Its just a trait, not worse or better
really I don&amp;rsquo;t delay , just choosy about whom to cater
I planned to explain everything, but will do that later</description>

      <description>My Yearlong One Poem a Day
I am athiest still I pray
Good or bad whatever it may
there&amp;rsquo;ll be differant shades of gray
Path is unknown and its dark
cause of procrastination I always park
or days when I don&amp;rsquo;t feel that spark
Still I know I will hit three Sixty Five mark
Doing for 21 days Makes it your habbit
To master you spend 10000 hours doing it</description>
