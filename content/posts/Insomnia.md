Try try till you succeed, I keep hearing  
can't fall asleep however I try sleeping  
Got tested with all types of medical tests  
Doctors don't have answers it really frustates  
  
I tried endlessly surrfing TV channels  
My fingers aches also have strained eyes  
Friend of mine figured our whats the problem  
It is lifstyle which ruined my Circadian rhythm  
  
Still remember regular parties late night   
By the time they are over sun shined bright  
If there were no parties I had social media  
Time passed as if I am affected by Amnesia  
  
I always knew there was a problem  
will fix it soon was my favourat claim  
that soon kept extending never actually came  
I was fooling myself and enjoying my game  
  
Even Now its not too late  
Possiblity of sleep innate  
Planning sounds always great  
Difficult is to change routine which is set  
  
I don't know this was blessing or not  
But I have a life I totally forgot  
It was message from body that its high time  
message learnt hardway won't forget lifetime
