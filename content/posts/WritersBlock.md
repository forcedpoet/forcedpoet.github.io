First time in Little Life, I hit writers Block  
Feeling suffocating as, on chest I have a rock  
Crowding inside I have words, Choking me more  
I wish to vent them, out of chest I could bore  
  
this is wierd feeling difficult to express  
more I try it, more I get feeling of stress  
I know the words originate from brain's some part  
they travel all the way down by train of thought  
  
on the way thoughts pass through station of eyes  
they add from there experience like some wise guys  
they continue journey down vocal cord try to utter  
and slip down in chest whete they accumulate  
Here they have station of heart so they wait  
  
When I was forcing them to become what I want them  
I came up so many reasoning explaing which were lame  
I finally gave up on idea,and tired me lie down  
everything fell in place, words comming on there own  
  
It took some time to make sense and find out  
Learning from this, reality lifes hard blow  
More I tried more It became clearer about  
Not forcing me will help maintaining my flow.
