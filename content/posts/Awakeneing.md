Its not pleasing but its important  
snoozing alarm every day makes it redundant  
simmilar in life realising   
there is problem is't pleasing  
  
In that moment life takes U turn  
shatters dreams like earthen urn  
we have tendancy of shooting messanger  
so we distract ourself running farther  
  
this is really is worse trick  
as clock doesn't stop to tick  
do we really feel better then  
may be yes that is fleeing from pain  
  
It doesn't help any bit  
rather more worsens it  
we may forget about problem  
realising it makes me overwhelm  
  
embrace the situation thats true awakening  
take problems head on and keep improving  
one by one when you solve problems  
In hot desert cool breeze it feels  
  
though desert is hot thats bitter reallity  
cool breeze momentory soothing sensuality  
So awakening is like crossing the desert  
leaving all confort takes lot of effort  
  
If you persist at continued efforts taking one step a time  
be it big or small but making progress is our goal prime  
when you keep progrssing toward your goal one fine day  
you will be out of missery and free to do what you may  
  
Keep in mind your hardships you have gone through  
all the times when your time was nothing but tough  
never ever forget this very very crucial thing  
everything can be solved it starts with awakening
