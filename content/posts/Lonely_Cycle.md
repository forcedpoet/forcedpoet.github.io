I am lonely in corner of garage  
is it you comming or another mirage  
I often dream going out with you  
I am sure you feel the same too  
  
I remember early days of our relationship  
it was love at first sight or rather peep  
Looking through hole of that crowded werehouse  
I was eagely waiting to break chains go loose  
  
I cherish those memories of early days  
your being possesive about me all ways  
keeping me clean was always a priority  
Boasting about me being most pretty  
  
those splashes of water through nozzle  
cleaning me till I shine like a pearl  
all those long rides to all those places  
smile on your face, looking thos impressed faces  
  
I clearly remeber that perticular unfortunate day  
Not even foe should go through this, I pray  
I saw her for the first time and felt jealous  
It was royal enfield, which was getting famous  
  
second wife feels this way, I am sure   
specially she is beutiful and younger  
I was abandoned and she was prime  
No longer we go out, nor spend time  
  
I have nothing to look forward in life  
my frame has rusted and joint are stiff  
I was optimistic for some days but not any longer  
now I see myself rust here or being sold to scrap dealer.
