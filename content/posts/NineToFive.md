Yes I work at Nine to Five  
pobably I am sleep deprive  
I have no one to blame for this  
tired of chasing that comp increase  
  
I remember how I have started as a fresher  
full of hopes and feeling hell lot better  
out of collage I was eager to work  
good work was sufficient enough perk  
  
As I was burdoned with more and more of it  
there came one point where I coudn't take it  
Still continued for that month end credit message  
Convinced my self there is no way I have to manage  
  
As time passed gradually everything was routine  
realisation few ephameral moments but they fade in  
it was mechanically going on trying hard to please  
I understood what exactly means "Ignorance is bliss"  
  
That awakened moment was worst thing that happened  
Not know if it was really Atleast thats how then it seemed  
knowing you have a problem is first step towards solving  
started taking responsiblity than easily others blaming  
  
It is not a great position to be in   
but better than what would have been  
now taking bold steps to improve situation  
comming of of vicious cycle relived most of tension
